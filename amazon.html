			<p>The Amazon rainforest is the biggest, most important, rainforest in the word. It is the home to about 
			a fourth of the world's land animals. If the forest continues to burn, it will turn into an entirely 
			different ecosystem unsuitable for its the animals and plants to survive. 
			</br></br>
			The Earth depends on the Amazon as one of its last sanctuaries for many species like jaguars, harpy 
			eagles, and pink river dolphins, and it is home to sloths, black spider monkeys, and poison dart frogs 
			much more. One out of 10 species consider the Amazon rainforest as their home. These add up to about 
			40,000 plant species, 3,000 fresh fish species, and more than 370 types of reptiles. For a span of 20, 
			over 2,000 new species in the Amazon have been described. </p>

					The  Amazonian rain forest is a home to various different species which 
					includes the blue-and-yellow macaw. Macaws are known to be highly intelligent, 
					and they can live for up to 60 years. The color and pattern of their feathers 
					are what makes them distinguishable and popular among the species in the illegal 
					pet trade. This pet trade has devastated and affected many populations of wild 
					exotic birds.

					extensive deforestation, it put the monkey on the endangered list.
