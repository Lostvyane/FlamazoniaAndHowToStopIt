			<p>Iâ€™m glad that you took some of your time to visit and read our website. 
			Before anything else, I would like to greet you a happy new year! As we all 
			know, the Earth has been experiencing various environmental issues such as 
			climate change, global warming, melting of glaciers and etc. If we will not 
			make an action RIGHT NOW, there might not be a future for all of us. I hope 
			that you would help and support us in our advocacy. Your help means a lot to 
			us and to the future generations.</p>

					<h1>Hi, I'm Amiel Bolando</h1>
					<p>Hoping for a better planet this 2020! A new year means a new generation 
					is about to be born into this world. But what kind of world would they be 
					seeing if we dont initiate action right now?  It takes time to make Earth 
					a beautiful place again. Earth has changed immensely this past few decades, 
					but there is still time to make a better difference in this new one!</p>

			<p>Wishing you guys a happy New Year! You've probably made a few plans for the new 
			decade. Well, I'm sorry to say this, but we might not even make it to the end of this 
			one. Things may seem okay now but all of it  can change in a blink of an eye. You may 
			not notice it but our planet is dying, animals are going extinct, the ozone layer's 
			collapsing and we're still barely moving or doing anything about it. Though, we still 
			have time to fix it. Help us by donating and/or planting trees and limiting your emission 
			of pollution. Do your part to save our world. If we work together, we might still have a 
			future to look forward to.</p>
