				<p>The millions of animals that live by the roots are also affected by the damages in the

				<p>Tribes like the Awá (Earth's Most Threatened Tribe), the Wau Wau, and many others are

				The lives of more than a million indigenous people are at risk. </p>

				<p>The fires contribute to carbon emissions. Rainforests play a vital role in the world’s 
				ecosystem since they absorb heat instead of it being reflected back into the atmosphere.

				<p>Many have been blaming Brazil's president, President Bolsonaro, who decreased the 
				IBAMA's (Brazil's environmental agency) by about 24% in April 2019. Hence, they were 
				not able to monitor the forest and protect it from illegal loggers and those to start 
				fires.</p>
			</div>
			<div class = "info4container">
				<img src = "../images/cattle.jpg">
				<p>The fires are also being blamed on the cattle ranchers and loggers who use the Amazon's 
				land for large meat production companies. They use the fires to clear areas of the Amazon 
				to raise their cattle for money which is mostly likely to be the cause of the fire. Majority 
				of the Amazon fires were human-lit, said Christian Poirier (program director of non-profit 
				organization Amazon Watch).</p>
			</div>
			<div class = "info4container">
				<img src = "../images/causesfire.jpg">
				<p>The fires are releasing a great amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere while also 
				destroying millions of trees that would have been able to convert all the carbon dioxide 
				into oxygen and reverse the effects of the fires in the atmosphere. </p>
